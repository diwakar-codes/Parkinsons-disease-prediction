# Parkinsons-disease-prediction
This is ML model trained on Parkinson's disease using SVM algorithm where both on training and testing the accuracy is similar.

Parkinson’s Disease Prediction 🧠⚡

📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict whether a person has Parkinson’s disease based on biomedical voice measurements. Early detection of Parkinson’s disease can help in effective treatment and improve the quality of life for patients.

The notebook contains data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and results visualization.
